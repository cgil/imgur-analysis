<h2>A little explanation</h2>
<div class="info" style="height:100%;">
	<p>
		These visualizations are a representation of the <strong>imgur data set</strong>, acquired by scraping their public site. <br/>
		Using these graphs I tried to find interesting correlations in the data over different time periods. <br/>
		A lot of <strong>assumptions</strong> have been made, most importantly, that most users live and work within the U.S. <br/>
		This new data set is a simple aggregate of points, ups, downs and so on over the past 4 years (2011-March 2014). <br/><br/>
		There are 5 data sets (or groupings) for which I collected data. <br/>
		These are: <strong>hours, weekdays, months, years, and deltas</strong> <br/>
		Additionally there are 3 data types: <strong>images, comments, and deltas</strong> <br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		All code on how this was made can be found in <a href='https://github.com/cgil/imgur-analysis'>this public repo.</a> Please play with it!
