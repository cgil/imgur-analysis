<h1>An imgur scraper and data visualizer.</h1>

<p>
The scraper hits public api end points on imgur and aggregates data based on different time lapses such as hours, weekdays, months, years, and deltas. The aggregated data is then stored into several mongodb collections. <br/>
Then we use d3 http://d3js.org/ to visualize the data and form graphs.

custom.html and custom.js introduce extended functionality that allows the creation of custom graphs on the fly.
